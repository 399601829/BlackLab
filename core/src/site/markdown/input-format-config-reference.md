# Input format configuration file reference

NOTE: this is a reference for the new way of indexing, using index format configuration files, available starting from BlackLab 1.7.0. The older, more direct way of indexing is still supported (although parts may be removed or changed in future versions); see [here](indexing-with-blacklab.html).
